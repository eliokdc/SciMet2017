## The Datasets
In this report, I use datasets from the Brazilian Department of Labour. These datasets contain information about people registered as regular workers, following the "CBO" (brazilian official classification of professions).
Because of the law structure in Brazil, it's possible to have underrepresentation for some professions (like doctors and lawyers, that sometimes register as partners in their business), and sometimes we also have a problem concerning the profession used for the registration, since sometimes a professional can be registered in two different ways (e.g. economists sometimes are registered as "analysts").


We have six datasets, each one representing a different profession: architecture, medicine, engineering, economy, law and street cleaning, and they present information about number of hours, salary average, the salary minimum per hour, the gender, the age and employment time.

## The Hypothesis:
Using this data, the objective is to identify how these different factors (age, gender, scholarity, profession, etc) can impact the average salary. More specificaly, I would like to identify:

1. Is there a gender discrimination? If it is the case, in which profession we have the biggest salary gap per gender?

2. What is the impact that scholarity have in the average salary?

3. How does the age affect the salary?

## First Dataset: Economist set
We have seven variables in this dataset: contract hours, age, gender, scholarity, average salary, minimum per hour, and employment time. The table bellow was generated using R "summary" command and sit shows the general

* Scholarity: 

Looking in how concentrate are the values for scholarity, I concluded that it would be difficult to infer information considering different scholarities inside a profession. However, probably it would be interesting to see how it behaves comparing different professions.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
load(file="data/economist.Rdata")
meanE <- mean(economist$Scholarity)
std <- sd(economist$Scholarity)
ggplot(data = economist, aes(economist$Scholarity)) + geom_bar(fill="white", colour = "black") + labs(x= "age")+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept = meanE, colour = "mean")) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = (meanE + std), colour = "std"), linetype = "dashed") +  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = (meanE - std), colour = "std"), linetype = "dashed")  + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(economist$Scholarity), colour = "median"), linetype = "dashed")   + 
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Central Tendency Measurements", breaks = c("mean", "std","median"), values= c(mean = "red", std = "blue", median = "orange")) 
```

* Age:

```{r}

meanE <- mean(economist$age)
std <- sd(economist$age)
ggplot(data = economist, aes(economist$age)) + geom_bar(fill="white", colour = "black") + labs(x= "age")+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept = meanE, colour = "mean")) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = (meanE + std), colour = "std"), linetype = "dashed") +  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = (meanE - std), colour = "std"), linetype = "dashed")  + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(economist$age), colour = "median"))   + 
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Central Tendency Measurements", breaks = c("mean", "std","median"), values= c(mean = "red", std = "blue", median = "orange")) 


```


# age x salary
```{r}
qplot(economist$avg_salary, economist$age, xlab = "Average Salary", ylab = "Age") + geom_smooth()

```

However, here we are not considering the amount of hours that each economist is doing per month, and it can give us the false impression that someone young is receiving a lot more money, where in reality they could only be working more.

```{r}
qplot( (log(economist$avg_salary) / economist$contract_hours), economist$age, xlab = "Average Salary per Contract hours", ylab = "Age") + geom_smooth()

```
