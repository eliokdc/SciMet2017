SUBJECT: Studying the salary difference in Brazil

Dataset from the Brazilian Department of Labour, more specificaly from the RAIS report (Social Informations Annual Report), for one of the 27 brazilian states.

SUMMARY: 

Using this data, the objective is to identify how these different factors (age, gender, scholarity, profession, etc) can impact the average salary. More specificaly, I would like to identify:

1. Is there a difference between the average salary between genders? If it is the case, in which profession we have the biggest salary gap per gender?

2. What is the impact that scholarity have in the average salary?

3. How does the age affect the salary?

HOW TO REPLICATE:

In the folder script, there is one script that treat and save the data in the exact form that is used on the RMarkdown format.

COMMENTS:

I provided a PDF version, but the report is really "nicer" to be read on the html format.
